**Developer: Mr. Arshad Khan**

This repository holds code for GUI application with Python (Ver.3.10). Tkinter module is used to build most of the GUI Applications. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. All the projects build in this repo are created as a part of Core and Advanced Python Traing Program. Following are the screenshots of GUI applications made during the training:
